## :beginner: About
At the moment the application features an initial take on the base, functional GUI, which allows the user to go through the process of a customer (and their instrument) registration.

The main interface is in a form of a TabPane nested within another TabPane, which allows the user to have multiple calibration projects (files) opened and to edit them simultaneously.

In the current version, the core feature of the application is a valuation tab. It allows the user to prepare a comprehensive quote of a calibration service requested by the client (according to their selection of measurement ranges / points and some other device-specific factors like e.g. display resolution).

An early version of the tab for estimating the measurement uncertainty (uncertainty budgets) has also been implemented (not fully functional yet).

See the [:zap: Usage](#zap-usage) section for more in-depth information on how to handle specific UI components and how to go through the service valuation step.

## :bulb: Technologies used
- JavaFX (GUI)
- Java SE 19 (base logic)

## :star2: Features
- base GUI that allows the user to perform customer registration and to input necessary instrument data 
- fully functional Service Valuation tab for preparing a calibration service quote, based on the DUTâ€™s type, resolution (if applicable) and selected measurement functions / ranges / points
- validation for most input fields used so far to prevent both missing/incorrect data, but also more subtle errors like illegal calibration range/points outside the CMC boundaries, negative AC values etc.

## :zap: Usage
To test the application in its curent state just download the latest [pre-release](https://github.com/RobertR-01/mini-casino/releases), unzip it and run the `.jar` file.

#### :electric_plug: Requirements
- Windows OS
- Java 19+

## :wrench: Development
The application is still under development. The project's source code the can be freely cloned, inspected and modified using an IDE of choice.

#### :pencil: Pre-Requisites
- JDK 19 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA or any other IDE with Maven support

#### :nut_and_bolt: Installing JARs
The game uses some graphics stored as an external JAR archive. Due to the nature of the Maven Shade plugin for creating fat JARs and how JavaFX accesses graphic files, JARs containing these resources are installed as a local Maven repository and added to the pom.xml as a dependency. This process should be done in case of any modifications to the current resources or any new JARs being added.
Currently the JARs which need to be installed are kept in the `mini-casino/JAR` directory, and the local Maven repositories are installed in `mini-casino/lib`.

To install a JAR as a local Maven repository use this Maven goal template:

    mvn install:install-file
    -Dfile=JAR/symbols.jar
    -DgroupId=com.minicasino.graphics
    -DartifactId=slots_graphics
    -Dpackaging=jar -Dversion=1.0.0
    -DlocalRepositoryPath=lib

The usage of the local repository is indicated in the pom.xml as follows:

    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>Local repository</id>
        <url>file://${basedir}/lib</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>


Any new dependency used in the project and coming from this repository must be also added to the pom.xml, e.g.:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.minicasino.graphics</groupId>
      <artifactId>slots_graphics</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
